The "Functional Split" (No Class)
"Take the following Python code and refactor it into separate Jupyter Notebook cells. Remove the class structure and make it procedural. Group them logically:

Imports

Variable/Model Initialization

Helper functions

The core logic/chain

An execution/testing cell. Ensure it is optimized for step-by-step debugging."

The "Deep Explainer" (For Learning)
"Split this code into a notebook-style format. For every code cell, provide a brief Markdown cell above it explaining the purpose of that block. Also, identify any external dependencies or file paths I need to be aware of before running the cells."



Create "VS Code Interactive" .  want variables to persist between blocks.

Specify Error Handling: If the original code has complex try/except blocks, "Keep the error handling intact but make the output readable in the notebook console."

Ask for Placeholders: If you don't have the files ready, add: "Replace specific file paths with clear placeholder variables at the top of the script."


- save IT as filename_ipynb.ipynb in a folder named classExplanations

convert  this into ipynb file file: #file:{{file}}
